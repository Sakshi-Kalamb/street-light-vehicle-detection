# street-light-vehicle-detection
An Arduino-based automatic street light system that turns ON when a vehicle is detected using IR sensor.
# 💡 Automatic Street Light Control System using Vehicle Detection

An Arduino-based smart street lighting system that automatically turns the light ON when a vehicle is detected and turns it OFF after a delay. Helps conserve energy and promotes automation in urban infrastructure.

## 🎯 Features

- Detects approaching vehicle using IR sensor.
- Automatically switches street light ON.
- Turns OFF light after delay if no vehicle detected.
- Energy efficient and fully automatic.

## ⚙️ Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensor Module
- Relay Module / Transistor
- LED or Street Light Bulb
- 9V Battery or Adapter

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Arduino C/C++
- Sensor-based automation
- Embedded system logic
